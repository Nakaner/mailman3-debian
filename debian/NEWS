mailman3 (3.1.1-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  Package 'mailman3-core' renamed to 'mailman3':

  To avoid further confusion, the package 'mailman3-core' got renamed to
  'mailman3'. We decided to not provide complex migration tools as the
  package is very young and has never been part of a stable release yet.

  In case you want to keep your existent mailman3-core database, you're
  advised to make a backup now and re-import it after the installation of
  mailman3.
