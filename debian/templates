_Description: The service for mailman3 failed!
 The mailman3 service didn't start correctly. This is probably because
 you didn't configure the database appropriately. The service won't work
 until you do so.
 .
 If you actually DID install the database appropriately, please report
 the bug to the maintainers of the mailman3 package.
